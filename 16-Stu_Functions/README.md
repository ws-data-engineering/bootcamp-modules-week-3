# üèóÔ∏è Write Function to Evaluate Equality of Two Values

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to know when two values are equal to one another.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I provide two values in function arguments and the function evaluates the values' equality.

* It's done if, when the values are strictly equal, the message "They are equal in type and value" is logged.

* It's done if, when the two values are equal but not strictly equal, the message "They are equal in value" is logged.

* It's done if, when the values are not equal or strictly equal, the message "They are not equal" is logged.

* It's done if, when the `isEqual` function is rewritten as a function expression and when called with values that are not equal or strictly equal, the message "They are not equal" is logged.

## üí° Hints

How can we use parameters to give a name to the two values that we want to evaluate with the function?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is hoisting?

In JavaScript, hoisting refers to the built-in behavior of the language through which declarations of functions, variables, and classes are moved to the top of their scope ‚Äì all before code execution. In turn, this allows us to use functions, variables, and classes before they are declared.
