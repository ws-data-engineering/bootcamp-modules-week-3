# üêõ Logs Using Logical and Conditional Operators Return False

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* When I open the console, all the logs should read `true`, but right now they do not!

## Expected Behavior

When an expression is logged to the console, it should return `true`.

## Actual Behavior

When an expression is logged to the console, it returns `false`.

## üí° Hints

What is the difference between `=`, `==`, and `===`?

`=` - Assignment Operator
`==` - Equality Operator (Checks equality, attempts to convert different operands to achieve equality)
`===` - Strict Equality Operator (Considers different types to be different)

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is `NaN`? What happens when you use `typeof` to evaluate `NaN`? Is the answer what you expected? Why or why not?

NaN stands for Not a Number. It is a value of numeric data types (usually floating point types, but not always) that represents the result of an invalid operation such as dividing by zero. Although its names says that it's not a number, the data type used to hold it is a numeric type.
