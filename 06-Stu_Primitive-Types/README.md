# 📐 Add Comments to Implementation of typeof to Evaluate Primitive Types

Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in [Unsolved](06-Stu_Primitive-Types/Unsolved/script.js).

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:

[MDN Web Docs on typeof](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof)

[MDN Web Docs on JavaScript data types and data structures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures)

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* There are two more primitive value types in JavaScript. Can you explain what `BigInt` and `Symbol` are?

BigInt values represent numeric values which are too large to be represented by the number primitive.

Symbols are used used to avoid name clashes when using properties, privacy (when you don't want your object properties to be enumerable) and protocols (defining how an object can be iterated).

*Symbols create unique objects.

The JavaScript Symbol is a primitive data type, just like Number, String, Boolean, etc. It represents a unique identifier and can be used in various ways. Symbols are used to create object properties, for example, when you want to assign a unique identifier to an object.

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
